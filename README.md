# Rental Management System
It is a web-app to find rentals suited to your needs or publish your properties which are available for rent. It's backend has been developed in Django.
Given are some of the screenshots of our web-app:

Opening the web-app this is the **Homepage** :

When you proceed to view the properties, you get a Signup Page with a link to the login Page, if you have already signed up. _(Signup page is very similar to the login page)_.
The **Login user page**, where the user (landlord/tenant/visitor) can login to see properties and the visitor can rent any property _(if available)_ .

The Tenant Dashboard is also similar to that of the Owner but instead of the owned properties, it'll display your rented property and the rent due amount.
